I study the the physics of the ocean, mostly at scales that are relevant to the forward cascade of energy towards 3D turbulence and ocean mixing. I am interested in both the processes that lead to ocean mixing, as well as the impact that mixing has on the physics, biology and chemistry of the ocean.

I am a graduate Student under the suppervision of Dr. Ruth Musgrave. My research focusses on the effects of depth varying current on lee wave propagation and energetics. I joined the group in 2020, after a bachelor’s degree in Water Engineering at Université Laval.

As for my hobbies, I
play indoor and beach volleyball. I also enjoy trekking and rock climbing.

I am a MSc student currently working with Dr. Ruth Musgrave. My research focuses broadly on turbulence and mixing in the ocean and seeks to address questions like: what methods can be implemented to ensure that turbulence is quantified easily and accurately at sea? To what extent is mixing enhanced over topographical features like the Canada Basin shelf break in the Arctic Ocean? I am also working on a project closer to home---a numerical model of mixing within Bedford Basin. The model will provide insights into the specific situation of alkalinity release in the Bedford Basin surface layer. The carbonate chemistry and dispersal of alkalinity in the ocean is of particular interest, as [ocean alkalinization](https://oceanalkalinity.com/what-is-ocean-alkalinity-enhancement/) has been proposed as one possible method for removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. This work will support the Dartmouth company [Planetary Hydrogen](https://www.planetaryhydrogen.com/) as they develop a carbon-negative method for hydrogen fuel production and alkalinity release.
